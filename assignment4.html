   // Create an array called monthsOfTheYear that includes all 12 months.
   // Create a switch statement that returns a string with how many days
   // are in each month based on which month is chosen. Have it print the
   // string statement using document.write for each month. It should print
   // out a sentence similar to:
   // 'February has 28 days except on leap year when it has 29.'
   // We will be expanding on this assignment in a future video.
   // For now, have the variable you create in the switch set to January.
